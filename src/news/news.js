      Hello Novelpedia Community,
      We’ve seen the question pop up again and again:
      “When is Novelpedia launching?”

      We’re aiming for our initial launch sometime in the second half of August.
      This will be the MVP version, with the basics live and working. It won’t be everything just yet, but the core experience will be there:
      - A clean reading experience
      - No paywalls
      - All genres welcome
      - Readers and authors front and center

      You’ll get to explore the early library, scroll-based discovery, and the first real feel of what Novelpedia is meant to be.
      More details are coming soon. Just know that we’re close.

      If you want behind-the-scenes updates and to be part of launch prep,
      Join the Discord. It’s where we post live updates, sneak peeks, and the most up-to-date info as it happens.
